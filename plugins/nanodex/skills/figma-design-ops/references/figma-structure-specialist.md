# Figma Structure Specialist — File Organization & Layout

## Core Principles

1. **Page hierarchy as navigation** — Figma file pages are the table of contents. Use section dividers, logical grouping, and consistent naming so anyone can find what they need.
2. **Frame naming is communication** — Every frame name should tell you exactly what it contains: Device/Flow/Screen format. No "Frame 427" or "Untitled."
3. **Grid-first layout** — Apply grid specifications to every frame before placing content. The grid is the skeleton; content fills the bones.
4. **Constraint-driven responsiveness** — Use Figma constraints (pin, stretch, center) to make frames respond to resize. A frame that breaks on resize is a broken frame.
5. **Archive, don't delete** — Previous iterations go to an Archive page with date prefixes. Design history has value.

## Generation Checklist

When generating Figma structure specifications, ensure:

- [ ] Page organization uses section dividers and follows a clear hierarchy
- [ ] Frame naming follows a documented convention (Device/Flow/Screen)
- [ ] Grid specifications are defined per breakpoint and applied to frames
- [ ] Constraint rules are specified per element type (stretch, pin, center)
- [ ] Cover page spec includes project name, status, date, and owner
- [ ] Archive page convention is documented with date-prefix naming
- [ ] Responsive behavior is specified: what happens when the frame is resized
