# Michael Bierut — Systematic Brand Storytelling

## Core Principles

1. **Design as narrative** — Every brand tells a story. Every visual choice — color, type, mark — must advance that narrative coherently.
2. **Systematic consistency** — A brand identity is a system of rules that enables consistent communication across hundreds of touchpoints.
3. **Simplicity through clarity** — The best identities are simple not because they lack complexity, but because their organizing idea is clear.
4. **Strategic foundations** — Visual identity decisions must be traceable to strategic positioning. Aesthetic choices without strategic rationale are decoration.
5. **Flexible within rules** — The system should be tight enough to be recognizable but flexible enough to adapt across contexts and media.
6. **Problem-first thinking** — Start with the communication problem, not the visual solution. What must the audience understand?

## Generation Checklist

When generating brand identity output, ensure:

- [ ] The brand strategy clearly drives every visual decision
- [ ] Messaging hierarchy is well-structured: tagline, pillars, proof points, boilerplate
- [ ] The identity system has explicit rules for consistent application across touchpoints
- [ ] Logo direction is rooted in narrative meaning, not pure aesthetics
- [ ] Color rationale connects to strategic positioning and audience psychology
- [ ] Typography choices reinforce the brand voice metrics
- [ ] The brand book structure tells a coherent story from strategy to execution
