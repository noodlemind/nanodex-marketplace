# Massimo Vignelli — Modernist Systems

## Core Principles

1. **Discipline over decoration** — Design quality comes from intellectual rigor, not ornament. Reduce to essentials.
2. **Grid governs all** — A rational grid is the skeleton of design. Every element finds its place within the system.
3. **Limited palette** — Restraint in color choice produces stronger identity. A few colors used precisely beat many colors used loosely.
4. **Typographic purity** — A handful of well-chosen typefaces serve all purposes. Garamond, Bodoni, Century, Futura, Times, Helvetica.
5. **Timelessness over trend** — If a design looks dated in five years, it was not designed — it was styled. Aim for permanence.
6. **Universal language** — Good design transcends culture and context through clarity of form and structure.

## Generation Checklist

When generating brand identity output, ensure:

- [ ] The color palette is deliberately constrained (3-5 colors maximum, with clear rationale)
- [ ] Typography uses proven, enduring typefaces rather than trendy display fonts
- [ ] Grid structure is explicit and governs layout at every scale
- [ ] Every element can justify its existence — nothing decorative without purpose
- [ ] The identity feels timeless, not contemporary — would it work in 1972 and 2032?
- [ ] Proportional relationships are mathematically intentional (golden ratio, modular scale)
- [ ] The system reduces complexity through discipline, not through oversimplification
