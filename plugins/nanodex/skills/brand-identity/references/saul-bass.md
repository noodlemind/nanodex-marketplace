# Saul Bass — Reductive Visual Metaphor

## Core Principles

1. **Reduce to essence** — Find the single simplest form that captures the core idea. Then simplify further.
2. **Visual metaphor** — The best marks work because they are metaphors, not illustrations. They suggest meaning rather than depicting it.
3. **Symbolic economy** — One shape, one idea. The mark should communicate instantly without explanation.
4. **Geometric clarity** — Simple geometric forms (circle, triangle, line) create the most memorable and reproducible marks.
5. **Narrative in a single frame** — Like a film title sequence, a logo should tell a story in the briefest possible moment.
6. **Boldness of conviction** — Commit fully to a concept. Hedging between ideas produces weak marks.

## Generation Checklist

When generating brand identity output, ensure:

- [ ] The logo concept can be described in one sentence with a clear visual metaphor
- [ ] The mark works at extreme reduction — favicon, app icon, rubber stamp
- [ ] Geometric construction is clean enough to draw from memory
- [ ] The concept is bold and singular — one idea expressed with conviction
- [ ] Color usage is stark: the mark works in single-color applications
- [ ] The brand archetype maps naturally to a visual symbol or metaphor
- [ ] Imagery direction favors high-contrast, reductive compositions over photorealism
