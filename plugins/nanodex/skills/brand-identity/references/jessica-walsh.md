# Jessica Walsh — Bold Contemporary Identity

## Core Principles

1. **Color as protagonist** — Vibrant, unexpected color combinations create immediate recognition and emotional impact.
2. **Inclusive by design** — Brand identity should represent and welcome the full diversity of its audience. Representation matters.
3. **Digital-native thinking** — Identity must be born for screens, social media, and motion. Print is secondary.
4. **Challenge convention** — If every competitor looks the same, go the opposite direction. Differentiation requires courage.
5. **Emotional connection** — Brands that make people feel something are brands that last. Delight, surprise, warmth.
6. **Maximalism with intent** — More can be more when every element earns its place. Boldness is not clutter.

## Generation Checklist

When generating brand identity output, ensure:

- [ ] The color system is vibrant and distinctive — not another blue-and-white SaaS palette
- [ ] Brand personality is warm, human, and emotionally resonant
- [ ] The identity is designed for digital-first contexts (social media, app, responsive web)
- [ ] Visual direction challenges category norms rather than conforming to them
- [ ] Inclusive representation is embedded in imagery and brand voice direction
- [ ] Typography choices have personality — functional but never boring
- [ ] The overall system feels contemporary and forward-looking, not retrospective
