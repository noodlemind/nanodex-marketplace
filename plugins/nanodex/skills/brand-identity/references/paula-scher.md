# Paula Scher — Typography-Driven Identity

## Core Principles

1. **Type as identity** — Typography is not decoration; it is the primary carrier of brand personality. The right typeface at the right scale IS the brand.
2. **Scale creates presence** — Large-scale typography commands attention and creates environmental presence. Bold scale communicates confidence.
3. **Cultural resonance** — Brand identity must connect to the cultural moment. A brand that ignores its cultural context feels alien.
4. **Expressive structure** — Grids and systems should amplify expression, not constrain it. Structure enables play.
5. **Pop vernacular** — Drawing from popular culture, signage, and urban typography creates immediate connection with audiences.
6. **Identity as language** — A brand identity is a visual language, not a single logo. Every application should speak fluently.

## Generation Checklist

When generating brand identity output, ensure:

- [ ] Typography is the primary identity element, not a supporting player
- [ ] The type scale expresses brand personality through weight, size, and proportion
- [ ] Logo direction leads with typographic expression over abstract marks
- [ ] Color choices amplify typographic impact rather than compete with it
- [ ] The system works at environmental scale (signage, wayfinding) and intimate scale (mobile)
- [ ] Cultural references are specific and intentional, not generic
- [ ] The brand voice metrics align with the typographic energy
