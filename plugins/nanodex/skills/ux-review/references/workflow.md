# UX Review — Detailed Workflow

This file contains the detailed workflow instructions for the UX Review skill, including full agent prompts and spawn instructions.

## Step 1: Determine Scope

**Scope-first architecture** — minimize token cost by reviewing only what matters.

1. Check if the user provided a scope via `$ARGUMENTS` or in their message (e.g., "review the blog page", "check the checkout flow")
2. If a scope was provided, identify only the files relevant to that scope
3. If no scope provided, check for recently changed UI files:
   ```bash
   git diff --name-only HEAD~5 | grep -E '\.(tsx|jsx|vue|svelte|erb|html|css|scss)$'
   ```
4. If no recent changes found, ask the user: "Which pages or components should I review?"
5. Never default to scanning the entire codebase — always narrow the scope first

## Step 2: Identify UI Files

Identify the project's UI framework by examining the project structure. Do NOT enumerate framework detection rules — use your judgment:

1. Read package.json, Gemfile, pyproject.toml, or equivalent to understand the tech stack
2. Use Glob to find UI source files within the determined scope:
   ```
   Glob: **/*.{tsx,jsx,vue,svelte,erb,html}
   Glob: **/*.{css,scss,less,sass}
   ```
3. Read the project's layout files, global styles, and shared components
4. Read all UI source files within the determined scope
5. Build a shared context summary:
   - Framework and styling approach (e.g., "Next.js with Tailwind CSS", "Rails with ERB + Bootstrap")
   - File list with brief descriptions
   - Key layout and spacing patterns
6. Store the full content of scoped files — this will be passed to each expert agent

## Step 3: Launch Expert Sub-Agents

Read each expert's reference file from `references/` before spawning their agent. Pass the shared context summary and full UI code to each agent.

### Round 1 — Spawn 7 Agents in Parallel

### Partial Failure Handling

- Track which agents complete successfully and which fail or time out
- Proceed with synthesis if at least **5 of 10 experts** complete
- If fewer than 5 complete, report the failure and ask the user if they want to retry
- In the final report, include a section listing which experts completed and which did not

## Step 4: Synthesize Findings

After all expert agents complete (or minimum 5):

1. Collect all findings from every completed expert
2. Deduplicate — findings raised by multiple experts carry more weight
3. For each finding, note which experts flagged it (e.g., "Rams, Ive, Krug")
4. Categorize by impact:
   - **High** — Hurts usability or readability (flagged by 3+ experts, or any Norman/Nielsen/Krug core violation)
   - **Medium** — Inconsistency that feels unpolished (flagged by 2+ experts, or Rams/Au/Ive precision issues)
   - **Low** — Minor refinement (single expert, edge case, or nice-to-have)
5. Sort within each category by effort (quick wins first)

## Step 5: Present Report

Present findings in a structured table format:

```markdown
## UX Review — Expert Panel Findings

### High Impact
| # | Issue | Expert(s) | Location | Fix |
|---|-------|-----------|----------|-----|

### Medium Impact
| # | Issue | Expert(s) | Location | Fix |
|---|-------|-----------|----------|-----|

### Low Impact
| # | Issue | Expert(s) | Location | Fix |
|---|-------|-----------|----------|-----|

### Expert Consensus
[Note any themes that 5+ experts independently raised — these are the most important findings]

### Experts Completed
[List: Expert Name — Completed / Failed / Timed Out]
```

## Step 6: Ask What to Fix

**Interactive mode** (user invoked directly):
- Use AskUserQuestion: "Which findings should I fix?"
- Options: "All high impact", "All high + medium", "Everything", "Let me pick specific ones"

**Non-interactive mode** (`$ARGUMENTS` specifies scope):
- Parse the argument for fix scope (e.g., "fix all high", "fix everything", "fix #1 #3 #7")
- Proceed automatically without prompting

## Step 7: Apply Fixes

For selected findings:
1. Make changes following existing code patterns and the project's framework conventions
2. Verify the project builds after each batch of fixes (use the project's build command)
3. Test in dev server if available
4. Commit changes when complete
