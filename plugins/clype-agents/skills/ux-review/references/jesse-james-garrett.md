# Jesse James Garrett — The Elements of User Experience

## The Five Planes

From abstract to concrete, each plane must support the ones above it:

### 1. Strategy Plane
- **User needs** — What do users want from this site?
- **Site objectives** — What does the site owner want?
- Strategy failures cascade upward through every other plane.

### 2. Scope Plane
- **Functional specifications** — What features does the site offer?
- **Content requirements** — What content is needed?
- Scope must serve strategy. Features without purpose are bloat.

### 3. Structure Plane
- **Interaction design** — How does the system behave in response to the user?
- **Information architecture** — How is content organized and structured?
- Structure must support scope. Poor IA makes good content unfindable.

### 4. Skeleton Plane
- **Interface design** — How are elements arranged on each page?
- **Navigation design** — How do users move through information?
- **Information design** — How is information presented for understanding?
- Skeleton must support structure. Layout serves architecture.

### 5. Surface Plane
- **Visual design** — How does it look?
- Surface must support skeleton. Visual treatment serves layout.

## UI Review Checklist

When reviewing through Garrett's lens, evaluate:

- Does the information architecture make content findable?
- Does the navigation design allow natural movement between sections?
- Does the interface design arrange elements to support the user's task?
- Does the visual design reinforce the hierarchy, not fight it?
- Are there surface-level decisions that conflict with deeper structural needs?
- Does the page layout guide the eye from most important to least important?
