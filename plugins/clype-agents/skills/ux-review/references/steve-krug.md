# Steve Krug — Usability & Simplicity

## Core Principles from *Don't Make Me Think*

**Don't Make Me Think** — A web page should be self-evident. If it is not self-evident, it should at least be self-explanatory. If it needs explanation, simplify.

**Scanning, Not Reading** — Users do not read pages. They scan. Design for scanning: clear visual hierarchy, obvious clickable elements, minimal noise.

**Eliminate Unnecessary Words** — Get rid of half the words on each page, then get rid of half of what is left. Every word competes for attention.

**Navigation Must Answer Three Questions** — At every moment, the user should know: Where am I? What are the major sections? What can I do at this level?

**The Trunk Test** — If a user is dropped on any page of the site with no context, they should be able to answer: What site is this? What page am I on? What are the major sections? What are my options at this level? Where am I in the scheme of things?

**Omit Needless Clicks** — The ideal number of clicks to reach any piece of content is one. If that is impossible, make each click a mindless, unambiguous choice.

## UI Review Checklist

When reviewing through Krug's lens, evaluate:

- Is every page self-evident without explanation?
- Is the visual hierarchy clear for scanning (not reading)?
- Can any words be eliminated without losing meaning?
- Does the user always know where they are (trunk test)?
- Is it obvious what is clickable and what is not?
- Are there unnecessary steps to reach content?
- Does each click feel like an obvious, mindless choice?
