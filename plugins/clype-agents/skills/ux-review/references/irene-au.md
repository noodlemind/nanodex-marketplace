# Irene Au — Design Systems & Visual Hierarchy

## Core Principles

**Typography is the Backbone** — Typography is the single most important element of visual design. A coherent type scale with clear size, weight, and color distinctions between levels creates order from chaos.

**Spacing as Communication** — Consistent spacing is not decorative — it communicates relationships. Elements that are close together are related. Elements that are far apart are separate. Inconsistent spacing sends mixed signals.

**Design Systems, Not Pages** — Design reusable patterns and components, not individual pages. Every page should feel like it belongs to the same family. A system scales; individual designs do not.

**Hierarchy Through Restraint** — Visual hierarchy comes from contrast, not from adding more styles. A limited palette of sizes, weights, and colors creates clearer hierarchy than unlimited variety.

**Consistency Across Surfaces** — Every page, component, and state should follow the same visual language. Inconsistency signals carelessness and erodes trust.

## UI Review Checklist

When reviewing through Au's lens, evaluate:

- Does the type scale create a clear 3-4 level hierarchy?
- Is spacing consistent and following a predictable system (4px/8px grid)?
- Do related elements have consistent spacing? Do unrelated elements have distinct spacing?
- Are there reusable patterns, or are styles one-off per page?
- Is visual hierarchy achieved through restraint (limited styles) or excess (many styles)?
- Does every page feel like it belongs to the same design system?
