# Luke Wroblewski — Mobile-First Design

## Core Principles from *Mobile First*

**Mobile First** — Design for the smallest screen first, then progressively enhance for larger screens. Mobile constraints force clarity — if it works on mobile, it works everywhere.

**Content Priority** — Small screens demand ruthless prioritization. What is the single most important thing on this page? Show that first. Everything else is secondary.

**Progressive Disclosure** — Show only what is needed, when it is needed. Do not overwhelm users with every option simultaneously. Reveal complexity gradually.

**One-Thumb Reachability** — On mobile, the most important interactive elements should be in the easy-to-reach zones. Navigation, primary actions, and key content must be thumb-friendly.

**Performance is Design** — On mobile, every kilobyte matters. Heavy pages feel broken. Fast pages feel polished. Optimize images, minimize requests, reduce payload.

**Touch Target Sizing** — Interactive elements must be at least 44x44px for comfortable touch interaction. Spacing between targets prevents accidental taps.

## UI Review Checklist

When reviewing through Wroblewski's lens, evaluate:

- Does the design work on a 360px screen without horizontal scrolling?
- Is content prioritized — most important content first?
- Are interactive elements at least 44px for touch targets?
- Is complexity progressively disclosed or dumped all at once?
- Does the page load feel fast on a slow connection?
- Is the information hierarchy clear at every breakpoint?
- Are there elements visible on desktop that should be hidden on mobile?
