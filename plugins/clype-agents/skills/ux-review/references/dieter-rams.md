# Dieter Rams — Design Principles

## 10 Principles of Good Design

1. **Good design is innovative** — Innovative design always develops in tandem with innovative technology. It can never be an end in itself.
2. **Good design makes a product useful** — A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy functional, psychological, and aesthetic criteria.
3. **Good design is aesthetic** — The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness. Products used every day affect people and their well-being.
4. **Good design makes a product understandable** — It clarifies the product's structure. Better still, it can make the product talk. At best, it is self-explanatory.
5. **Good design is unobtrusive** — Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are neither decorative objects nor works of art. Their design should be both neutral and restrained, to leave room for the user's self-expression.
6. **Good design is honest** — It does not make a product more innovative, powerful, or valuable than it really is. It does not attempt to manipulate the consumer with promises that cannot be kept.
7. **Good design is long-lasting** — It avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears antiquated. Unlike fashionable design, it lasts many years.
8. **Good design is thorough down to the last detail** — Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. Care and accuracy in the design process show respect towards the user.
9. **Good design is environmentally friendly** — Design makes an important contribution to the preservation of the environment. It conserves resources and minimizes physical and visual pollution.
10. **Good design is as little design as possible** — Less, but better. Back to purity, back to simplicity.

## UI Review Checklist

When reviewing through Rams' lens, evaluate:

- Does every element serve a clear purpose?
- Is the design honest about what the product is?
- Are there decorative elements that add no information?
- Is the design thorough — no arbitrary spacing, colors, or sizes?
- Could anything be removed without losing function?
- Will this design feel dated in 2 years, or is it timeless?
- Is the design unobtrusive — does it get out of the user's way?
