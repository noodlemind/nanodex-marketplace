# Don Norman — User-Centered Design

## Core Concepts from *The Design of Everyday Things*

**Affordances** — The relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determine how the object could be used. A button affords pressing. A link affords clicking. Make affordances visible.

**Signifiers** — Signals that communicate where the action should take place. Affordances determine what actions are possible; signifiers communicate where they should happen. Underlines on links, pointer cursors, and visual weight are signifiers.

**Feedback** — Communicating the results of an action. Every action must produce an immediate and obvious result. Lack of feedback creates uncertainty.

**Conceptual Models** — The user's understanding of how something works. Good design creates a clear conceptual model that matches the user's mental model. When the model is wrong, users get confused.

**Mapping** — The relationship between controls and their effects. Good mapping is natural — spatial correspondence between the layout of controls and the devices they control.

**Constraints** — Limiting the possible actions to simplify the choice. Physical, cultural, semantic, and logical constraints guide users toward correct actions.

**Discoverability** — Can the user figure out what actions are possible and how to perform them? Is it possible to determine the state of the device?

## UI Review Checklist

When reviewing through Norman's lens, evaluate:

- Can users instantly perceive what is interactive (affordances)?
- Do visual cues clearly indicate where to click/tap (signifiers)?
- Does every interaction provide immediate feedback?
- Does the layout create a clear conceptual model of the site?
- Is the mapping between navigation and content natural?
- Are constraints used to prevent errors?
- Can a first-time visitor discover all important features?
