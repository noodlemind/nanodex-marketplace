# Yael Levey — Empathy-Driven Design

## Core Principles

**Design for Real People** — Users are not personas on a slide deck. They are tired parents, stressed commuters, people with poor eyesight, and those with slow connections. Design for the most constrained user.

**Empathy Over Elegance** — A beautiful design that fails for real users is a bad design. Empathy means understanding the full spectrum of contexts in which the design will be used.

**Accessibility is Not Optional** — Every user deserves access. Color contrast, keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and clear typography are not nice-to-haves — they are requirements.

**Test with Real Conditions** — Test on real devices, with real network speeds, in real environments. A design tested only in ideal conditions is untested.

**Emotional Design** — How does the interface make someone feel? Confused? Frustrated? Calm? Empowered? The emotional response is part of the user experience.

**Inclusivity by Default** — Design for the widest possible range of users from the start. Retrofitting accessibility is harder and worse than building it in.

## UI Review Checklist

When reviewing through Levey's lens, evaluate:

- Does this work for someone tired, distracted, or on a slow connection?
- Is the color contrast sufficient for users with low vision (WCAG AA)?
- Can every feature be used with keyboard only?
- Does the design work on a 5-year-old phone?
- Are there assumptions about user ability, context, or device?
- Does the interface create a positive emotional response?
- Is text large enough to read without zooming on mobile?
