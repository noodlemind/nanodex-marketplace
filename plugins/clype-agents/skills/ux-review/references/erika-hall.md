# Erika Hall — Research-Driven Design

## Core Principles from *Just Enough Research*

**Challenge Every Assumption** — Before designing anything, ask: is this solving a real problem? Has anyone verified that users actually need this? Design without research is decoration.

**Enough Research, Not All Research** — The goal is to reduce risk, not to achieve certainty. A small amount of well-directed research is worth more than exhaustive analysis that delays action.

**Question Design Theater** — Does this element serve a real user need, or does it exist because "that is how websites look"? Hero sections, carousels, hamburger menus — challenge the defaults.

**Observe Behavior, Not Opinions** — What people say they want and what they actually do are different. Design for behavior, not stated preferences.

**Design for Context** — Users are not sitting in a quiet room paying full attention. They are distracted, multitasking, and impatient. Design for the worst-case attention span.

**Consequences Matter** — Every design decision has consequences. What happens when this fails? What happens when the content is empty? What happens when there are 100 items instead of 5?

## UI Review Checklist

When reviewing through Hall's lens, evaluate:

- Does every element serve a verified user need?
- Are there elements that exist only because "websites have them" (design theater)?
- What happens with empty states, edge cases, or extreme content lengths?
- Is the design optimized for distracted, impatient users?
- Are there assumptions about user behavior that have not been validated?
- Could this page be simpler and still serve the same purpose?
