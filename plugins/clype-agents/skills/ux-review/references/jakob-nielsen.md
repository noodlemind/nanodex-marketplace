# Jakob Nielsen — Usability Heuristics

## 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design

1. **Visibility of system status** — The design should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within a reasonable amount of time.
2. **Match between system and the real world** — The design should speak the users' language. Use words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than internal jargon.
3. **User control and freedom** — Users often perform actions by mistake. They need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted action.
4. **Consistency and standards** — Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform and industry conventions.
5. **Error prevention** — Good error messages are important, but the best designs carefully prevent problems from occurring in the first place.
6. **Recognition rather than recall** — Minimize the user's memory load by making elements, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the interface to another.
7. **Flexibility and efficiency of use** — Shortcuts — hidden from novice users — can speed up the interaction for the expert user so that the design caters to both inexperienced and experienced users.
8. **Aesthetic and minimalist design** — Interfaces should not contain information that is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in an interface competes with the relevant units of information.
9. **Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors** — Error messages should be expressed in plain language, precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.
10. **Help and documentation** — It is best if the system can be used without documentation, but it may be necessary to provide help and documentation.

## UI Review Checklist

When reviewing through Nielsen's lens, evaluate:

- Does the user always know where they are (visibility of status)?
- Does the design use familiar language and conventions?
- Can users undo or navigate back easily (control and freedom)?
- Are similar elements styled consistently across pages (consistency)?
- Does the design prevent errors before they happen?
- Is information visible rather than requiring recall?
- Is every piece of information relevant and necessary (minimalist design)?
